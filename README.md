This a fork of a custom mod made for [Project Flattened](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/project-flattened) modpack that allows players to spawn custom structure from an nbt file.   
  
It has 1 command:

*   `/placenbt <fileName>` 
    *   This swill spawn the structure at the block the player is at. No limits on how many structures like before
    *   File name argument can be left empty in which case the default one (`default_base`) is used
    *   All schematics are stored in `/config/pf_schematics` folder
    *   This command can only be run once per player

This mod could be added to other packs and used there for the same purpose, but was primarilly built for [Project Flattened](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/project-flattened) modpack to help support multiple starter bases in multiplayer environment.
